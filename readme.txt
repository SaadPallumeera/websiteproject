This repository contains all the necessary files for the Chemistry Calculations website, which is built using Django. The website offers various tools and calculators to help students and professionals perform common chemistry calculations. However, the website is currently not operational and requires setup and deployment to function correctly.

Features
Molar Mass Calculator: Compute the molar mass of chemical compounds by entering their molecular formula.
Stoichiometry Solver: Perform stoichiometric calculations to determine the amount of reactants and products in a chemical reaction.
Concentration Calculations: Calculate molarity, molality, and other concentration-related values for solutions.
Gas Law Calculations: Solve for unknowns in gas law equations, including ideal gas law and combined gas laws.
Acid-Base Calculations: Determine pH, pOH, and other properties of acids, bases, and buffers.
Unit Conversion Tools: Convert between different units commonly used in chemistry (e.g., grams to moles, liters to milliliters).
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
